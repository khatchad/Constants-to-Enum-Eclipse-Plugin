      The plugin refactors Java legacy code to make use of the new
enum program construct which was introduced in Java 1.5. This
construct, which provides language support for enumerated types,
is one of many new features of Java that offer significant improvements
over older Java technology. Prior to Java 1.5, programmers were
required to employ various design patterns (e.g., static final
int ...) to compensate for the absence of enumerated types in
Java. Unfortunately, these compensation patterns lack several
highly-desirable properties of the enum construct, most notably,
type safety.
The Convert Constants to Enum refactoring for Eclipse provides
an automated approach for transforming legacy Java code to use
the new enumeration construct. This semantics-preserving tool
increases type safety, produces code that is easier to comprehend,
removes unnecessary complexity, and eliminates brittleness problems
that normally prevent separate compilation.
